    "*Matthew Kenworthy - Leiden Observatory*\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "For the last two weeks we have been focussing on coronagraphs. \n",
    "This week you will be looking at imaging data taken with a polarimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing unpolarised starlight from observations\n",
    "The data is of a star surrounded by a nearly face-on dust disk. You will carry out difference imaging to remove the unpolarised stellar flux and let the polarised flux shine through. The disk can barely be seen in the intensity image, but is clearly seen in the degree of linear polarization image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The polarization state of photons encodes information about the scattering of the photon from dust in circumstellar disks, and from aerosols in planetary atmospheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polarization data is from NaCo, an imaging camera that sits at the Nasmyth focus of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and the data is taken at a wavelength of 2.15 microns (K band). The data has been kindly provided by Jos de Boer at Leiden Observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "NaCo takes two images of an astronomical object through a Wollaston prism, which splits incoming light into two orthogonal polarized images which we will refer to as Left (L) and Right (R).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Half-Wave Plate is rotated so that **4** different polarization angles are imaged in the sequence 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees, and two polarized images are taken each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large number of images are taken so that time-varying and detector-varying effects can be removed. You will look at single differencing and double differencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, we are determining 3 numerical values for each pixel on the detector - representing $I, Q, U$ - and we have more data than unknown parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"polarization_setup.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The images themselves measure quantities that are expressed by these equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='equation1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}S_0(L) &= I + Q + Q_{IP}\\\\\n",
    "S_1(L) &= I + U + U_{IP}\\\\\n",
    "S_2(L) &= I - Q + Q_{IP}\\\\\n",

    "S_3(R) &= I + U - U_{IP} \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...where $Q_{IP}$ and $U_{IP}$ are the instrumental polarizations - initially, you can assume that these are zero, but when considering double differencing later on, they are nonzero."
